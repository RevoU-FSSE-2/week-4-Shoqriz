## Introduction
Hello everyone my name is Shoqri Muhammad Zidan, I made my own website with the theme of kpop idol NewJeans.

I will write documentation about deployment and everything else.

## Deployment

### Deploy Link

This is the [link](https://shoqrizidan.site/) to my website after I deployed it to my domain.

#### Step 1 : First, you must buy the domain. I am using [Niagahoster](https://www.niagahoster.co.id/).

### Change the Server Name
#### For the domain we bought to work we have to change the name server
#### Step 1 : We go back to NiagaHoster and select the "Manage Services" option and go to the Domain Overview Tab and there is a "Change Server Name" option.

#### Step 3 : Done and we have to wait for confirmation from Cloudfare for the website to be active, we will be sent an email and notified that our domain is active.
